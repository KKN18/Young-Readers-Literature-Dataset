Maya, a determined and clever Scottish teenager, discovers the strange truth behind her mother's double life as a witch. Now, under the often less than helpful guidance, of her know-it-all cat Mischief, she sets out on an epic adventure to rescue her mum, from a trap like no other. Enlisting the help of another young witchling, Evaline and some very special magical friends along the way, she must pass increasingly challenging initiation tests, to join the fearsome Coven of Deeds in order to secure her mother's release. All is not what it seems however, someone is out to thwart her at every turn. Who can Maya really trust? When her mysterious foe is finally revealed, and the breath-taking extent of the ingenious deception is revealed. One question still remains unanswered... what could have driven them to such extreme measures? The answer, when it comes, is more devastating for Maya and her friends than anyone could have imagined. Their fate and perhaps even the existence of magic itself, is under threat. Now, forced to flee by a seemingly invincible foe, they are led to Threave Castle. An ancient family residence, where the whole story is finally revealed and Maya must face the ultimate test of her courage and wits.Be warned, this is a highly original, imaginative and surprising adventure, an emotional rollercoaster of a book. Maya faces more challenges and unexpected plot twists and turns, than a fat hamster, stuck in a treacle filled labyrinth, complete with hidden trap doors and the occasional crocodile thrown in, just for fun.

None other than the mellifluous leg-rubbing of the somewhat disoriented Chester Cricket from Connecticut.

What ensues is an altogether captivating spin on the city mouse/country mouse story, as Chester adjusts to the bustle of the big city. Despite the cricket's comfortable matchbox bed (with Kleenex sheets); the fancy, seven-tiered pagoda cricket cage from Sai Fong's novelty shop; tasty mulberry leaves; the jolly company of Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat; and even his new-found fame as \"the most famous musician in New York City,\" Chester begins to miss his peaceful life in the Connecticut countryside.

There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn\u2019t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn\u2019t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people\u2014and to the pushcarts.The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world.

One day on a walk through Paris (a \"twelve little girls in two straight lines\" kind of walk), Madeline slips and falls off a bridge right into the Seine. Everyone feared she would be dead, \"But for a dog / That kept its head,\" saving her from a \"watery grave.\" What choice do Madeline and the girls have but to take the heroic pooch home, feed her biscuits, milk, and beef, and name her Genevieve? Sadly, when Lord Cucuface gets wind of the new dog, he decrees that no dogs will be allowed in the \"old house in Paris that was covered with vines,\" and kicks Genevieve out on the street. Madeline vows vengeance, and the girls scour Paris looking for the pup: \"They went looking high / and low / And every place a dog might go. / In every place they called her name / But no one answered to the same.\" As we've come to expect from Bemelmans, all's well that ends well chez Clavel, and young readers will be tickled by this heartwarming, quirky dog story with a surprise finale.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

When brainstorming the name of what resulted in the Diffendoofer School, he jots down several possible names\u2014\"William Wilkins Woofer Junior,\" \"Woodrow Watkins Woofer,\" \"Zoofendorf Elementary,\" \"J. Ebeneezer Bomberg Jr.\"\u2014all of a slightly different cadence and rhythm, which he tests like a composer writing a new concerto.A small collection of Geisel's rough sketches would be plenty to thrill even the Grinchiest of readers, but there's much more to this marvelous book. Renowned children's poet Jack Prelutsky and award-winning illustrator Lane Smith were called to action by Schulman to pull these sketches into a complete story that would make Dr. Seuss fruffulous with glee.Prelutsky's delicious verse is uncannily Seussian, and it is inexplicably sensational when exploring the Diffendoofer School to discover good old Horton, a platter of green eggs and ham, and a few Whos from Who-ville scattered across the surreal and fascinating landscape of Smith's artwork. Lane and Prelutsky have gone above and beyond the call of duty, maintaining the characters and themes Geisel was just beginning to develop, but enhancing them with their own delightful stylistic stamps.Above all, this incredible book is an ode to unorthodox, unusually creative teachers, and the innovative thinking they encourage in young minds. It is a noble theme, and one that Geisel surely had in mind when he concocted these preliminary sketches. Both new Dr. Seuss aficionados and those who remember \n'The Cat in the Hat's'\n 1957 debut will cherish this book for its message, artwork, and poetry, and most of all as a tribute to the man who inspired thousands of readers.Ages: 3 and older"}, {"title": "Our Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm", "description": "Meet the animals of Maple Hill Farm and learn about their antics as they bring joy, laughter, and life to the people who live in a house that needs painting at the end of a road full of holes.Two dogs, five horses, a pig, some geese, lots of chickens, a few cows, a few goats, several sheep, and four special cats\u2014these are the animals at Maple Hill Farm.With simple text that is both affectionate and wry, and irresistible illustrations that burst with personality, Alice and Martin Provensen bring their barnyard friends to life for the delight of animal lovers both young and old."}, {"title": "My Many Colored Days", "description": "Accompanying a manuscript Dr. Seuss wrote in 1973, was a letter outlining his hopes of finding \"a great color artist who will not be dominated by me.\" The late Dr. Seuss saw his original text about feelings and moods as part of the \"first book ever to be based on beautiful illustrations and sensational color.\" The quest for an artist finally ended\u2014after the manuscript languished for more than two decades\u2014at the paint brushes of husband-and-wife team Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher whose stunning, expressive paintings reveal such striking images as a bright red horse kicking its heels, a cool and quiet green fish, a sad and lonely purple dinosaur, and an angrily howling black wolf.

Zelinsky has once again with unmatched emotional authority, control of space, and narrativecapability brought forth a unique vision for an age-old tale. Few artists at work today can touch the level at which his paintings tell a story and exert their hold.Zelinsky's retelling of Rapunzel reaches back beyond the Grimms to a late-seventeenth-century French tale by Mlle. la Force, who based hers on the Neapolitan tale Petrosinella in a collection popular at the time. The artist understands the story's fundamentals to be about possessiveness, confinement, and separation, rather than about punishment and deprivation. Thus the tower the sorceress gives Rapunzel here is not a desolate, barren structure of denial but one of esoteric beauty on the outside and physical luxury within. And the world the artist creates through the elements in his paintings the palette, control of light, landscape, characters, architecture,interiors, costumes speaks to us not of an ugly witch who cruelly imprisons a beautiful young girl, but of a mother figure who powerfully resists her child's inevitable growth, and of a young woman and man who must struggle in the wilderness for the self-reliance that is the true beginningof their adulthood.As ever, and yet always somehow in newly arresting fashion, Paul O.

How could everyone in a castle - even the flies on the walls - sleep for a century and then wake up? This magical, beautifully illustrated tale begins when the king excludes the most difficult fairy of the kingdom from a feast celebrating the birth of his beautiful daughter Briar Rose. Furious, the fairy storms in and curses the baby, pronouncing that on her fifteenth birthday she will be pricked by a distaff (from a spinning wheel) and fall down dead. The youngest fairy softens the curse to a century-long sleep. Despite the fact that the king burns all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, 15-year-old Briar Rose finds herself in the tower where the evil fairy and her fate await her. The drama of the spell unfurls as she and the other inhabitants of the castle fall instantly asleep, from courtiers to kitchen maids. Thorny briars - moodily captured by Trina Schart Hyman's masterful paintbrush - grow up around the castle. Hyman depicts those who died attempting to break through the maze of thorns to reach the legendary sleeping beauty in a nightmarish illustration. But goodness and true love prevail when the perfect prince does finally find his way through the thick vines.Hyman won a Caldecott Medal for her work in Saint George and the Dragon by Margaret Hodges, and her version of The Sleeping Beauty makes us believe in the magic of the spell.

He was 5 months old, (now going on 6!) and didn\u2019t have his forever home yet and he was starting to fret! His friend, parrot Captain Jack, the mascot of the Pet Palace, tried to tell Max things would work out and be alright, but Max was still worried and afraid, and he couldn't sleep at night. Another pup at the Palace, Pugslee the Pug, just told Max she would be going soon. Her forever family picked her out of the bunch and she was excited to start her new life. Max was happy for her, but sad to see her go. Sad for himself too. When would he get his own family and forever home? The Boxer Brothers liked to tease. They told Max no one wanted him was because he was \u201c...so funny looking with all those spots. You look like you got chicken pox!\u201d they made fun. Max hung his head and almost started to cry, but didn\u2019t want them to see. His tears he tried to hide. Captain Jack told Max \"don't pay them any mind. They don\u2019t know any better than to be bullies and be mean and unkind.\" \u201cMax you are U-nique. You are special and one of a kind. You are a special dog and should be proud of his heritage and the history of the Dalmatian breed and hold your head high.\" That night when Max went to sleep, he dreamed and he dreamed of what his life would be. Where would he end up and where would this lead? A nice life with a little girl or boy, and a nice family possibly? Or would he be part of a Firehouse team, as a fireman\u2019s dog, riding along at top speed? Would he be a member of a circus troop, performing tricks and flips for cheering crowds at the show? He smiled at the thought of being in the spotlight, but then worried what if no one wanted him like the Boxers had teased? What if he ended up at the pet orphanage under lock and key. The Poodle sisters had warned him about this place for unwanted pets called The Society. Max tossed and he turned at that thought of this. Captain Jack had told him please not to fret. Even though The Society does good deeds, Max still was scared and didn\u2019t want to end up there please. Then his dream turned to worse and he remembered the tale from long ago, the one that haunts all Dalmatians where ever they go. Of the woman who loved spots, so much in fact, she wanted 100s of spotted dogs to hang on her racks and make up her wardrobe with spotted coats, gloves and hats! \u201cOh no!\u201d Max cried and covered his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to see this coat nightmare, he didn\u2019t want to lose his hide! \u201cNow, now, my young friend, that is just a story.\u201d Captain Jack tried to calm him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. For there is a place where Dalmatians can live, free from harm, without a care in the world, and always safe and sound. Where they can run and play all day long, dig in the dirt and chase butterflies and squirrels.\u201d \u201cWhat is this place.\u201d Max asked with a whine. \u201cIt\u2019s a place in your heart and for all good Dalmatians to find. It\u2019s there, you can trust me I have heard the tale told. Let yourself dream of running and playing all through the fields. And I hope your sweet puppy dog dreams will come true, very soon, this time for real.\u201d And with a pat on his head, like a good dog Max did as told. He went back to bed and the wonderful dream began to unfold. Of this magical place with green fields of grass, a big white house with huge old oak trees guarding the pass. Then he saw a sight, something he could hardly believe. Another Dalmatian like him, also running care free. Max smiled and he barked running happily in his dream.

It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health.All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported.The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals.The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance, almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described-- the months they become available, how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and how long they keep-- with illustrations of each pepper.An all-new \"RULES\" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect souffle.New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles:Separate new chapters on grains, beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes.New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts, cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different kinds of cheesecake-- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception without a hitch.Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta, tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons.AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment, integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy.Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections.From cover to cover, Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and cooking teachers.

BOOKS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL ARMOR FOR KIDS How can an adventure book empower children and make them safer? \"A spoonful of adventure makes the psychology go down,\" according to Dr. Molly Barrow, author of relationship books Matchlines for Singles and Matchlines for Step Parenting and practicing psychotherapist. Just as Mary Poppins helped children take their medicine with a little sugar, Barrow uses exciting adventure books to embed subtle positive messages about building self-esteem. \"Self-esteem is the single most important factor for the safety of a child,\" says Barrow. \"High self-esteem is psychological armor for children.\" During the past twenty years counseling families, Dr. Barrow has used humorous storytelling to explain complicated therapy concepts to young children and troubled teenagers. Children responded so well to her stories utilizing the Barrow Empowerment Theory that Dr. Barrow created the Malia and Teacup books to reach more children. How a child values themselves is the first line of defense in dangerous situations against school bullies, predators, and abuse. \"Prevention psychology is what we need now. Children must believe they deserve to be treated well,\" says Barrow. Experts link low self-esteem with drug and alcohol use, rebellion, suicide and school dropouts. The book and web site provide parents and teachers help with challenging discussion topics. L. A. psychologist and author Gerald Amada says, \"Exciting books with social and moral themes, like Malia and Teacup and Harry Potter do have the effect of improving self-esteem in children...and will become a part of the large corpus of children's literature that fosters their emotional well-being.\" \"Teachers, this book can lead to some great discussions, role playing and writing assignments!

The tone is simple, poignant and gentle which makes it suitable for children aged 8 to 10.The author, daughter of Holocaust survivor Manny Steinberg ('Mendel' in the story), emphasizes the importance of family, hope and love.The book has been illustrated with pencil drawings that beautifully depict the mood and era of the storyThis book does not contain any graphic details or violence.\"Passing along family history and the simple lessons of life to our children is maybe the most important responsibility parents have. Perhaps the most challenging lessons are those that deal with reality and the fact that bad things happen and children need to know this without scaring them.Anita Lavi tells a beautiful and compelling tale of a young lad and his brother who find themselves in a German Concentration Camp during the wanning days of World War II. As it turns out, the title character, Mendel, is author Lavi's father. Mendel, a Jew, is uprooted from his home and thrust into unspeakable horrors....we know. But Ms. Lavi is writing a children's book so while we who are reading this lovely story to our little ones, know the details of history, the book Mendel is written to teach without frightening.The family ultimately emigrates to the US, arriving to be greeted by Lady Liberty in New York harbor.If your family is Jewish, this a great book to start to teach the kids in a gentle way some of the more difficult parts of history. It is an excellent tool to generate healthy questions and discussions.My heritage is rooted in the Deep South of the United States with its history of slavery. Lavi's story is just as relevant here.To accompany the book, Ms Lavi has included a wonderful collection of simple pencil illustrations by Caroline Juler. The drawings are great punctuations in the story and themselves a great way to engage children and let them talk about what they see.Read this book to your children and then have a chat about Mendel and his family and then talk about your family.\""}, {"title": "Don't Stick Sticks Up Your Nose!

Far from being a \"City of Light\", for the poor and the homeless the streets of Paris are a dangerous and unforgiving place. For 11-year old Lucien they are now an amazing new home. Before being abandoned by his jealous older cousin, Lucien enjoyed a life of privilege. Raised as a young gentleman by his, wealthy, uncle, who took who took him in after he is orphaned, the old man instills in Lucien the values that will ultimately be his salvation. Upon his uncle?s death, Lucien?s cousin Gustave decides to rid himself of his new ward, rather than share any of his newly inherited wealth. It is this selfish ambition that lands Lucien - penniless, and alone - in the Tuileries Palace gardens in Paris, with only a treasured copy of ?Robinson Crusoe? to call his own. It is here that the desperate boy rescues a stray dog that is about to be killed by the palace guards. Doing his best for the badly injured animal, Lucien carries him along as he wanders the streets of the city in search of rescue. As the little dog regains his strength, the two become an inseparable team, caring for each other through good times and bad, like Crusoe and Man-Friday, in Lucien?s favorite book. By remembering the values of generosity, charity and optimism, instilled in him by his dead uncle, and with the help of his clever dog, the two manage to thrive on their own. In the end, by staying true to himself, Lucien succeeds not only in saving himself, but also in resurrecting his shattered family in ways he could never have imagined. Based on an incomplete work by Mary Nelson Carter, and adapted here, the lessons of \"A Fox in Paris\" are as meaningful to children (of any age) now as they were more than a century ago.

First, read aloud daily to your child from infancy through elementary school. This puts the correct flow of language into your child\u2019s mind, improves vocabulary, imparts knowledge, and helps your child practice visualization, a skill vital for future reading comprehension. In addition, recent research has shown that reading aloud produces good changes in your child\u2019s brain! Regular story time is so important! Second, provide your child with experiences in real life math. Some examples of this are in the Fun and Learning stories in this book. Measure things at home with rulers, yardsticks, and meter sticks, play games with dice, weigh things, and count money. Activities like these can help prepare your child for academics and even give him/her a head start!Stories About Me is a fun, educational book that's designed to be read aloud. It contains sixteen unique short stories in which your child is the main character! He or she will go on adventures, have fun, and learn new things!Stories About Me is divided into three sections. In the first section, the Fun and Learning stories entertain your child while demonstrating basic math activities involving fractions, measurement, simple addition, and more. In addition to reading the stories, you may choose to do the activities with your child. The goal is always exposure to the skill; you are building background and vocabulary. Some stories suggest giving the child an item like a ruler or a set of measuring spoons to hold and observe while you read aloud. Pictures of some items are included in the stories. The Safety section allows your child to visualize himself/herself learning or choosing safe behavior in various situations. In the Just for Fun stories, your child will see himself/herself riding a zip line, playing with friends at a birthday party, and more."}, {"title": "O psie, kt\u00f3ry je\u017adzi\u0142 kolej\u0105", "description": "Opowie\u015b\u0107 o ludziach i o pewnym psie, kt\u00f3ry jak prawdziwy turysta podr\u00f3\u017cowa\u0142 kolej\u0105 po ca\u0142ym kraju.W\u0142ochy to pi\u0119kny i malowniczy kraj na po\u0142udniu Europy.

Incredibly, each of the stories deals with ideas and issues that are being debated at home by her eccentric grandmother. She also learns that these are the ancient Vikram and Vetal stories, and that King Vikramaditya had asked for a boon wanting these tales to be handed down generations. But who is the old man? And what connects the girl to a king from ancient times? Deftly weaving together the age-old Vikram and Vetal stories with the mysterious happenings of a summer holiday, Poile Sengupta brings alive these classic tales in a new, energetic way. Funny, sad, serious and weird, this unique retelling proves how relevant these tales remain even today."}, {"title": "Yeh-Shen: A Cinderella Story from China", "description": "Over 1,000 years before the first European Cinderella story appeared, the tale of Yeh-Shen was part of China's storytelling tradition. \"Executed with chromatic splendor--a unique combination of brilliance and restraint.\"--The Horn Book.

BOOKS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL ARMOR FOR KIDS How can an adventure book empower children and make them safer? \"A spoonful of adventure makes the psychology go down,\" according to Dr. Molly Barrow, author of relationship books, Matchlines for Singles and Matchlines for Step Parenting and practicing psychotherapist. Just as Mary Poppins helped children take their medicine with a little sugar, Barrow uses exciting adventure books to embed subtle positive messages about building self esteem. \"Self esteem is the single most important factor for the safety of a child. Parents and educators should concentrate their efforts on inspiring children to value their self worth rather than compliance,\" says Barrow. \"High self esteem is psychological armor for children.\" Dr. Barrow's new fiction book for children, Malia and Teacup Awesome African Adventure illustrates complicated problem solving and demonstrates how to \"stay safe by staying strong.\" Malia's journey of self discovery is a fast paced and fun book to read, yet, the 342 page book with 30 illustrations contains hidden self esteem building messages. The book introduces young readers, ages 9 to 13, to important life lessons through the comedic misadventures of Malia and her tiny poodle. During the past twenty years counseling families, Dr. Barrow has used humorous storytelling to explain complicated therapy concepts to young children and troubled teenagers. Children responded so well to her stories utilizing the Barrow Empowerment Theory that Dr. Barrow created the Malia and Teacup trilogy to reach more children. How a child values themselves is the first line of defense in dangerous situations against school bullies, predators, and abuse. \"Prevention psychology is what we need now. Children must believe they deserve to be treated well,\" says Barrow. Experts link low self esteem with drug and alcohol use, rebellion, suicide and school dropouts. The book and web site provide parents and teachers help with challenging discussion topics. L. A. psychologist and author Gerald Amada says, \"Exciting books with social and moral themes, like Malia and Teacup and Harry Potter do have the effect of improving self esteem in children and will become a part of the large corpus of children's literature that fosters their emotional well being.\" \"Teachers, this book can lead to some great discussions, role playing and writing assignments.

The book starts off with a poem about honey bees, followed by a poem about the animals from the forests and seas, and a poem about a pure-hearted girl and her struggles in her new life in the city. Each page is filled with amazing and vibrant illustrations that children would surely adore. Join the characters of each poem as they tell the story of a whole different world from their perspective!Wayne Gerard Trotman's Rhyming Stories, introduced by Benjamin Zephaniah, is a fascinating and lovely series of poems that parents will surely enjoy reading with their children. It is filled with lessons mostly about the environment and animals, which is exactly what children need. The different poems truly helped me see the problems we are currently facing in our environment. Each poem has eye-catching illustrations, illustrated by Nhat Hao Nguyen, which added to the beauty of the stories and helped me clearly visualize the message each poem was trying to impart. I felt the sadness in each poem as they struggled to get through the problems they were facing and even sadder knowing that these problems are really happening around us. This book not only teaches us the consequences of the irresponsibility of mankind\u2019s actions but also presents us with solutions to help make the world a better place. Overall, this was truly an eye-opening and awe-inspiring book. Well done!Reviewed by Emily-Jane Hills Orford for Readers' Favorite - 5 StarsAn orphaned honeybee tells its sad tale of being alone, lonely, and unable to pollinate our fruit trees or even make honey. Sad, but true, that honeybees are an endangered species. Telling the story from a honeybee\u2019s point of view makes the tale all the more electrifying. \u201cI\u2019m from a land/ Across the sea/ An unhappy land/ Oh, what a pity/ There\u2019s no more milk/ And no more honey/ In what was once/ A place of plenty.\u201d The honeybee keeps meeting other living creatures and trying to explain its plight. It\u2019s a sad tale, almost too close to the truth. And then there\u2019s the story of Tun Tun, the six-year-old elephant whose greatest fear is the human poacher who threatens his family. \u201cRun Tun Tun Tun, run Tun Tun/ I see a poacher with his gun/ Don\u2019t wait for me just quickly flee/ Run Tun Tun Tun, run Tun Tun.\u201d You can hear the panic in Tun Tun\u2019s mother\u2019s voice; the poacher, of course, means danger.Wayne Gerard Trotman\u2019s Rhyming Stories: An Anthology of Seven Illustrated Children\u2019s Poems is a compelling look at what we\u2019ve done to our planet. Stories told in rhyming verse and accompanied by vibrant, colorful illustrations will teach readers young and old about the plight of other life forms on our planet and their struggle for survival. These are teaching stories, but parables too, cleverly told using the voice of the oppressed. The lyrical nature of the rhyming verses makes the stories sing their sorry tale and hopefully, the reader will listen, learn, and do all they can to change this downward trend toward disaster. But the stories are also fun, intuitive, and very insightful. These are stories about \u201call creatures great and small\u201d told with both care and compassion.Reviewed by Bruce Arrington for Readers' Favorite - 5 StarsWayne Gerard Trotman's Rhyming Stories: An Anthology of Seven Illustrated Children's Poems by Wayne Gerard Trotman is a collection of seven different stories, all in one large volume. The target audience is children, and so the illustrations are geared toward that age group. Most of the stories (The Last Honey Bee, A Tiger\u2019s Tale, An Elephant\u2019s Advice, Song of the Blue Whale, A Letter From a Gorilla, and A Turtle\u2019s Adventures) have strong conservation themes, targeting humans as the underlying cause of species population problems.Fortunately, the book also goes on to show that people can be a part of the solution instead of only the problem. This gives the reader a more hopeful view of how problems can be solved. The story, Mattie Boombalatty, is about a girl who is forced to move with her family because of a lost job. But the school is full of bullies and she has to deal with them. This is a fantasy story wherein a magical creature takes justice into his own hands, jeopardizing the lives of the bullies. Will Mattie stand up for them or let them go to ruin?The artwork is professional, colorful, and filled with lots of detail that will make the reader want to come back again and again. The artistic aspect helps young readers connect much better with the messages presented by the author.

But, without a doubt, the gorgeous illustrations are the real star of the show, created by Denise Fleming by pouring colored cotton fiber through hand-cut stencils. Readers and art appreciators of all ages will want to surround themselves with the delicious, ripe colors. Whether she's writing about traffic lights (\"We all must obey them / Even the Queen\"), a robin's nest, or the colors of fruit, Fleming imbues her subjects with vivid hues and exquisite shapes. Children will pore over the loosely organized book; the sparse structure allows readers to create their own stories, lingering over Summer, for example (with \"summer\" as its only text), to count the flies, spy the squirrel, and admire the pair of sunflowers. Readers can practice the alphabet, count crocodile eggs and ladybugs, make faces, learn about shapes, and play with kitchen \"toys\": cups, pans, spoons, bags. Towards the end of the book, the theme becomes nighttime-sleepytime, with verses about winking blinking fireflies and bunnies and chicks getting ready for bed. Children will love the big, color-drenched pictures and simple words. Grownups will want to frame the art and hang it all over their house.

He may be the youngest of all his brothers and sisters, but boy, he is definitely the most curious of them all! Because his older siblings chase him away when he tries to play with them, Donk spends a lot of time alone. Being the deep thinker that he is, this little donkey questions everything and fills his days trying to work out why certain things are the way they are.One day, Donk decides to try and find out the answer to a particular question that\u2019s been on his mind for a while. He cannot understand why the farmer is always shouting at him and the other donkeys on Donkey Farm, and why the farmer asks them why they are all so stubborn. Donk approaches everyone in his family, one by one, asking them to help him with his burning question. But his search is all in vain and poor Donk ends up none the wiser. Everybody seems too busy to explain properly and they all give him exactly the same answer.

This children's picture book, written and illustrated by Nicole Filippone, with a Foreword by Carol Stock Kranowitz (author of The Out-of-Sync Child), introduces sensory seeking SPD in a way that has never been done before. Read more about the book in the following review by Sheri Hoyte. \"Rosalee the A Sensory Processing Disorder Story\u201d written and illustrated by Nicole Filippone is an empowering story of a little girl with a heart as pure as gold and an endless supply of enthusiasm. Rosalee is expressive and passionate about the things she enjoys, things like drawing and creating, singing and playing. Sometimes she does things she\u2019s not supposed to do \u2013 but, \u201cnot on purpose!\u201d Rosalee has Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), and that means she just needs a little bit of help learning certain things, like personal space and organizing herself and her belongings. When Rosalee starts seeing Ms. Kat she learns so many things that help her get the sensory stimulation she needs \u2013 and this makes all the difference for Rosalee! Wow. There are so many positives going on in this book! I first learned that Sensory Processing Disorder was even a \u201cthing\u201d when author Nicole Filippone started talking about her plans for \u201cRosalee the Seeker\u201d in a Facebook group for children\u2019s authors and illustrators. I remember being impressed with such an undertaking, but I specifically remember thinking that if anyone is going to be successful bringing SPD to center stage for parents it is going to be Nicole. Though I don\u2019t know her personally, I feel like I\u2019ve gotten to know exactly the kind of person she is through this social media venue and what I\u2019ve learned is that she puts her whole heart \u2013 no, her whole being \u2013 into her work. That said, I was excited for the opportunity to read, \u201cRosalee the Seeker.\u201d Nicole brings SPD to the forefront in a manner both educational and engaging. Using specific examples, she shows how an everyday children\u2019s activity is taken to the next level with a child who has SPD. In one particular instance, Rosalee goes from drawing on paper to drawing on walls. While this seems like extreme behavior, it is a perfect example of how a behavior could naturally accelerate with a child who has SPD. Reading this story really caused me to pause and consider all sorts of things - from my own childhood to ways I might have done things differently with my own son had I been aware of such things. In a humble capacity, \u201cRosalee the Seeker\u201d calls attention to what may look like a child \u201cmisbehaving,\u201d but who actually has special needs. It inspires the message that one shouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume that a child acting-out has a discipline issue. This book will resonate with children and parents alike. Kids with SPD, or who know someone with SPD, will be able to point out specific behaviors, perhaps even indicating, \u201cHey, I do that too\u201d or \u201cSo-and-so does that.\u201d Being able to identify and relate to the story in a way that assures them there are other kids just like them is so important, and this story does just that. The same for parents \u2013 this story will produce several \u201caha\u201d moments and cause for consideration. The illustrations are bright and playful and Rosalee\u2019s personality jumps off the pages. The style is contemporary, irresistible and appealing to kids and adults. Little ones will engage in the story through the artwork and relate to Rosalee\u2019s vibrancy."}, {"title": "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts One and Two (Harry Potter, #8)", "description": "The eighth story, nineteen years later...It was always difficult being Harry Potter, and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and a father of three school-age children.While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son, Albus, must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.

Josh Campbell and Morgan Connelly stumble into their perilous journey when Josh discovers an ancient leather-bound book containing two scrolls. One is a legend about two coming to the Misty Lands from a far off place, finding the keeper of the sword, returning a king to an empty throne and preventing war.After drying the supper dishes, Josh watched TV with his mom until nine, returned to his room and booted up the computer. Gramps wasn\u2019t online. No email from him either. He took a shower, brushed his teeth went to bed, placed his head on a pillowcase, smelling faintly of lilacs, closed his eyes and fell into a dream.He looked down through gaps in a canopy of carrot orange, palm like leaves, streaked with thick daffodil veins, at a boy about ten years old, lying beneath the tree on his back, cradling his knees against his chest and crying. Flowers the size and color of the brass bell in the United Church bell tower, filling the air with a pungent musky perfume dangled down from the spreading branches.Resting in branches high above the weeping child, four big birds, black wings folded, cyan heads flashing iridescent reds, purples and greens in the moonlight pouring through rents in the heavy clouds kept sharp eyes on their charge.The largest of the birds spoke in a hushed voice, \u201cPoor young princeling, first his mother was poisoned, and now his father the king has been brutally murdered.\u201dAnother one grumbled, \u201cWe can\u2019t take proper care of him. He needs to be with his own kind.\u201d\u201cBesides,\u201d growled a third, it was as close to a growl as a bird can come, \u201cWe have our own younglings to tend to.\u201dThe fourth one asked, \u201cWhat are we then to do?\u201d If no one tends to him he\u2019ll die, and we can\u2019t let that happen, because he\u2019s now king.\u201dThe large bird answered, \u201cHe\u2019s far too young for us to take him back to the castle, because his enemies will kill him.\u201d\u201cI know, I know, I know what to do,\u201d shouted the fourth one.The other three spoke as one, \u201cWell, tell us.\u201d\u201cWe can take him deep into the forest where the old man and old woman live. They don\u2019t have younglings of their own. They\u2019ll tend to him and give him their love.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good plan,\u201d the others said, \u201cWe\u2019ll guide him on his journey when the sun wakes, but we can't tell them who he is.\u201dThe boy raised his right foot, scratched the instep, reveling the image of a red flower, starting at the ball and ending half way down the arch.Josh\u2019s dream changed, and now he looked down through cracks in the roof of a moss covered, cedar-shingled hut. Four men, two with long, curling grey beards, looking old enough to be his great-grandfather, a third, dressed in mottled grey and green, and a forth, sporting a shamrock-green hat, adorned with a long blue feather, sat around a table looking like it would crumple beneath the lightest sneeze.The man with the hat asked, \u201cHow am I to find my way?\u201dOne of the old ones reached under the table and lifted up a leather bag. He took out a black stone with a laser sharp cyan light lancing out of one side. He spoke in a reverent quiet voice, \u201cThis is the seeing stone of kings. Sometimes it is called the finding stone, and it will guide you to where the two who are spoken of in the prophecy wait.\u201dAway in the distance, carried by the breath of the wind came the wail of a single bagpipe, skirling a mournful dirge, reminding Josh of his great-grandfather, Donald McDonald. For a moment he saw the old man standing on a rocky promontory, silhouetted against the ruins of a castle, a kilt, bearing the tartan of the clan McDonald flapping around skinny legs, his dark eyes, eyes that always flashed when bonny Prince Charlie was mentioned, fixed towards a sun painting feathery clouds with vermillion, crimson and deep purple streaks.Over the tune, so familiar yet so strange came a voice, sweet, poignant, brushed with an Irish lilt, whispering at first, growing louder, filling him with an aching, a longing to go on board the great black ship she sang about. He held his breath in the depths of his dream, trying to burn each word, each haunting trill of the voice into his memory.\"In the moonlight gleaming/the Uniaedean rests, dreaming. Sails furled, captain sleeping/no one is watch guard keeping. Anchor set, gentle wind blowing, the great black ship dreams of going/to a mysterious, distant land/guided true by her captain's hand. Awake, awake, loud voice calling/war drums beat/flaming arrows falling. In fear Uniaedean awakens, shudders from deep wounds taken/looks long at moonlight gleaming/then returns to her dreaming.\"The men faded, the hut, and the words the men spoke faded , all the words of the song, except Uniaedean faded, but the aching caused by the voice lingered on, filling his dream with sadness, and he wept for the loss of the sweetness of the moment.He stirred in his sleep, tossed, turned, and found himself hovering over phosphorescent, midnight blue, and bathed in a river of moonbeams shimmering across the water. Josh struggled to wake up, but before he could, a ship sailed into view. How proud and bold she looked, with her black prow cleaving through tall white topped waves like a scimitar slicing through a pirate's neck.Her black sails filled with wind, struggling to free themselves from the ropes binding them, and a fiery-eyed black stallion figurehead, pawing the air with silver shod hooves glinting in the moonlight, seemed to urge the ship forward.Closer, ever closer came horse and ship, closer until he made out the name Uniaedean on the ship's side. The raised silver and turquoise letters glowed in the light of an unearthly green and silver flame surrounding them. For a moment he stood on the prow, looking over rippling muscled flanks, over the broad back, out between the black stallion's pointed ears, and heard a gruff loud voice shout, \"Trim the sails, hard to starboard,\" over the cracking of sails, the rushing of the wind.Salt spray stinging his eyes, cooled his brow. His heart thudded as if he'd just finished a ten-mile race, his throat tightened, he held his breath. Ahead of him, a mist gathering up from the sea spread out over the distant shore, swirling through strange looking trees, sweeping up towards far off snow covered mountains, not hiding the land, but adding a mystic fairy like quality to it. He blinked seawater from his eyes, and stood on a jagged dolomite tooth, banded by tourmaline and malachite, jutting out of the sea, surrounded by breakers pounding against his perch, soaking him, filling him with fear for the great black ship driving towards destruction. At the last moment, she turned sharp, heeling hard to starboard, heeling over until he thought she was doomed. He willed her to right herself before she foundered. The wind changed, catching her side, billowing out headsail, mizzen and main sails, righting her, and pushing her towards the east. He watched until the tip of the main mast dipped below the horizon, and just before he woke the voice, the sweet voice whispered, \"Come with me. Come with me.\"He sat up, sweat soaked, shivering, wiped tears from his eyes and tried to remember the voice, the words to the song, but the only thing remaining of his dream was the great black ship, and the fear and excitement of seeing her flying before the wind."}, {"title": "East of the Sun and West of the Moon", "description": "A young maiden searches for the noble youth whom she loves but who must marry the evil troll princess"}, {"title": "Sleeping Beauty: Classics Illustrated", "description": "The classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty.

Winnie-the-Pooh has appeared in twenty-one languages, among them Hebrew, Afrikaans, Esperanto, and Latin.This deluxe volume brings all of the Pooh stories together in one full-color, large format book.

As adults we have the experience, confidence and mechanisms to cope with complex issues. However, when the responsibility arises for guiding a child though a difficult time or familial loss, the hardest part can be breaking the emotional ice and starting the conversation. This book seeks to engage the child with familiarity and warm images and those of slowly transitioning into a difficult situation then expressing a positive outcome. The characters express grief, allowing for children to identify with these emotions as part of the healing process. Loss is an inevitable part of life and can be seen as transition rather than cessation. The concept of \"heaven\" is not necessarily meant to be religious, but gives the child a positive, soft place to emotionally \"land\" after confronting the grief. This is an opportunity to express to the child that their loved one, 4 or 2 legged, now exists in another place and space; be it heaven, all around us or in our hearts and memories."}, {"title": "The Wombles", "description": "The Wombles is the first in the Wombles series of books and introduces many of the favourite Womble characters, including the stern but kindly Great Uncle Bulgaria and Orinoco, fond of his food and a subsequent forty winks.Illustrated throughout in full colour by the talented Nick Price, this hardback edition of the first in the much-loved and classic Wombles series will make the perfect gift."}, {"title": "My Best Friend Is a Secret Agent: How Chip Became C.H.I.P. and Foiled the Freaky Fuzzy Invasion", "description": "From school goof to secret agent in just a few easy clicks...  \u201cIt\u2019s funny.

Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it! Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments? The shocking answer is: None of the above! In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind , T. Harv Eker states: \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint.\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money\u2014and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it. In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"Wealth Files,\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth. If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!"}, {"title": "N\u00b013 Max part en classe verte", "description": "Max a peur de quitter ses parents, et en classe verte, il se fait vite mal voir par le moniteur !

Dennoch f\u00fchlte er sich bem\u00fc\u00dfigt, dem Nachfolgeband Emil und die drei Zwillinge gleich zwei Vorworte voranzustellen: Eins f\u00fcr \"Fachleute\" -- also Kenner des ersten Bands --, und eins f\u00fcr \"Laien\", die von Emil, Oberwachtmeister Jeschke, Gustav mit der Hupe und Fr\u00e4ulein H\u00fctchen zuvor noch nie geh\u00f6rt hatten. In diesem Vorwort spielt K\u00e4stner augenzwinkernd auf den Erfolg von Emil und die Detektive an. Darin beschreibt er, wie er dem Titelhelden seiner Geschichte, dem im ersten Teil im Zug nach Berlin das Geld gestohlen wird und der dann mittellos durch die Gro\u00dfstadt irrt, bis ihm im Kampf gegen den Verbrecher Herr Grundeis Hunderte von Berliner G\u00f6ren zur Hilfe eilen, pl\u00f6tzlich in Steglitz \"leibhaftig\" gegen\u00fcbersteht.

Nicht so gut wie der erste Band, aber immer noch \u00fcberaus lesenswert. Als K\u00e4stner Emil und die drei Zwillinge schrieb, stand er vor einem Problem, das Fortsetzungen ber\u00fchmter Kinder- und Jugendbb\u00fccher bis hin zu Harry Potter immer wieder einmal haben: Ihre Helden altern. Deshalb sind Gustav, Fr\u00e4ulein H\u00fctchen und nat\u00fcrlich auch Emil selbst eigentlich schon ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen. Trotzdem: Wer diesen Doppelband zum Super-Sonderpreis ersteht, wird mit gleich zwei Klassikern belohnt.

Their faces and hands were made of white plaster, their bodies of rag, which meant they could bow most beautifully -- and Japanese people bow a great deal. Their eyes were slits of black glass and they had delicate plaster noses and red-painted mouths. Their hair was real, black and straight and cut in a fringe. They were exactly alike except that Miss Flower was a little taller and thinner, while Miss Happiness's cheeks were fatter and her red mouth was painted in a smile.They wore thin cotton kimonos -- a kimono is like a dressing-gown with wide-cut sleeves-and they each had a wide sash high up under their arms which was folded over into a heavy pad at the back.Miss Happiness had a red kimono patterned with chrysanthemums, Miss Flower's was blue with a pattern of cherry blossom; both their sashes were pink and on their feet they had painted white socks and painted sandals with a V-shaped strap across the toes.They were not new: Miss Flower had a chip out of one ear, her pretty kimono was torn and the paint had come off one of Miss Happiness's shoes. I do not know where they had been all their lives, but when this story begins they had been wrapped in cotton wool and tissue paper, packed in a wooden box and tied with red and white string, wrapped again in brown paper, labelled and stamped and sent all the way from San Francisco in America to England. I do not think they had been asked if they wanted to come-dolls are not asked.\"Where are we now?\" asked Miss Flower. \"Is it another country?\"\"I think it is,\" said Miss Happiness.\"It's strange and cold. I can feel it through the box,\" said MissFlower, and she cried, \"No one will understand us or know what we want. Oh, no one will ever understand us again \"But Miss Happiness was more hopeful and more brave. \"I think they will,\" she said.\"How will they?\"\"Because there will be some little girl who is clever and kind.\"\"Will there be?\" asked Miss Flower longingly.\"Yes.\"\"Why will there be?\"\"Because there always has been,\" said Miss Happiness.All the same Miss Flower gave a doll shiver, which means she felt as if she shivered though it could not be seen. Miss Flower was always frightened; perhaps the child who made the chip in her ear had been rough. \"I wish we had not come,\" said Miss Flower.Miss Happiness sighed and said, \"We were not asked.\"Children are not asked either. No one had asked Nona Fell if she wanted to be sent from India to live with her uncle and aunt in England. Everyone had told her she would like it, but \"I don't like it at all,\" said Nona.\"Nona is a good name for her,\" said her youngest cousin, Belinda. \"All she does is to say No, no, no, all the time.\"With her dark hair and eyes, her thinness, and her skin that was pale and yellow from living so long in the heat, Nona looked a stranger among her pink-cheeked, fair-haired cousins. There were three of them: Anne, who was fourteen, slim and tall; Tom, who was eleven, with freckles; and Belinda, who was a rough tough little girl of seven.Nona was eight. Her mother had died when she was a baby and she had been brought up by an old Ayah -- an Ayah is an Indian nurse -- on her father's tea garden, Coimbatore in Southern India. It had been hot in Coimbatore, the sun had shone almost every day; there had been bright flowers andfruit, kind brown people and lots of animals. Here it was winter and Nona was always cold. Her cousins laughed at her clothes; it was no wonder, for they had been chosen by old Ayah who had no idea what English children wore in England, and Nona had a stiff red velvet dress, white socks, black strap shoes and silver bangles. They laughed at the way she spoke English, which was no wonder either, for she talked in a sing-song voice like Ayah.She did not like the food; living in a hot country does not make one hungry and she had not seen porridge, or puddings, or sausages, or buns before, and \"No thank you,\" said Nona. She said \"No thank you- too when anyone asked her to go out for she had never seen so many buses and cars, vans and bicycles; they went so fast it made her dizzy. She said \"No thank you\" when her cousins asked her to play; there had been no other English boys and girls in Coimbatore and she had never ridden a bicycle, or roller-skated, or played ping-pong, or rounders, or hide-and-seek, or even card games like Snap or Beggar-my-neighbour. All she did was to sit and read in a corner or stand by the window and shiver. \"And cry,\" said Belinda. \"Cry, baby, cry.\"\"Belinda, be kind,\" said Nona's aunt, who was Belinda's mother. Nona called her Mother too. \"Be kind. We must all help her to settle down.\"All through Christmas Nona was unhappy and when Christmas was over it was no better. She stood by the window and ran her bangles up and down her wrist, up and down and round and round. They were thin and of Indian silver; she had had them since she was almost a baby and to feel them made her seem closer toCoimbatore.\"Come to the park, Nona.

The result of thorough research, keen insight, and unassailable common sense, Good Calories, Bad Calories immediately stirred controversy and acclaim among academics, journalists, and writers alike. Michael Pollan heralded it as \u201ca vitally important book, destined to change the way we think about food.\u201d Building upon this critical work in Good Calories, Bad Calories and presenting fresh evidence for his claim, Taubes now revisits the urgent question of what\u2019s making us fat\u2014and how we can change\u2014in this exciting new book. Persuasive, straightforward, and practical, Why We Get Fat makes Taubes\u2019s crucial argument newly accessible to a wider audience.Taubes reveals the bad nutritional science of the last century, none more damaging or misguided than the \u201ccalories-in, calories-out\u201d model of why we get fat, and the good science that has been ignored, especially regarding insulin\u2019s regulation of our fat tissue. He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight? What foods should we eat, and what foods should we avoid?

A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse-trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius \"fermentos\" (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The listener learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, the soil, farmers, our history and culture, and, of course, the people our cooking nourishes and delights. Cooking, above all, connects us.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume huge quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life."}, {"title": "Theater Shoes (Shoes, #4)", "description": "A beautiful gift edition of the beloved classic about three orphan siblings and their love of music, theater, and dance.\u00a0When orphans Sorrel, Mark, and Holly are sent to live with their grandmother, a famous English actress, she enrolls them in the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training, the same Academy that made the orphans from Ballet Shoes famous so long ago.

For countless generations the lives of the American bison and the Plains Indians were as one. Periodically stirred by the rhythm of the seasons, the great buffalo herds followed the ancient trails from north to south and back again, and the Indians followed the buffalo. It was a pattern and way of life regarded by both as inevitable. The Indians depended on the buffalo for food, for clothing and shelter, and for sport. In turn the buffalo accepted Indian hunts as only another natural hazard of their nomadic life, along with wolves and grizzlies, floods and droughts and blizzards. But with the coming of the white man, this age-old relationship was changed forever. Both Indian and buffalo, threatened with extinction, struggled desperately for survival. This Native American story is told through the lives of Standing Elk, a wise old Sioux medicine man, his headstrong, warlike son, Hawk, and Hawk's adopted brother, Stabs-the-Bear, in spite of his youth a \"far-seer\" like his foster father. Woven through their experiences and adventures are the ways of the buffalo, centered on the life of the king bull, Kahtanka, from birth through his sagacious later years as herd master. And opposed to these plains dwellers is the advancing, disrupting tide of the white man, with his guns, his railroads, his hide hunters, and his soldiers. Between them, Mr. and Mrs. Annixter have written four previous novels, many novelettes, and over five hundred short stories for almost every U.S. magazine. He was born in Minneapolis, she in Detroit. They have traveled throughout the United States, Canada, and parts of Mexico, mostly off the beaten paths. They now live in Pasadena, California, where they work with their hands at gardening or building when not at their typewriters or off mountain-climbing. They believe that the efforts of both head and hands are necessary for a balanced life, and that the world of nature is no less important than the works of man."}, {"title": "Rasmus, Pontus und der Schwertschlucker", "description": "Met het geld dat ze verdiend hebben in hun Vennootschap Verenigd Roest, gaan Stefan en zijn vriend naar de kermis.

Eigentlich hat sich Julia das ja ohnehin schon gedacht, als Mama f\u00fcr ihren kleinen, schleimigen Bruder Olli den wundersch\u00f6nen Adventskalender mit Schokoladenfiguren aus der Tasche zog und ihr, nur weil sie mit neun Jahren angeblich zu alt f\u00fcr Schokoladengeschenke ist, nur ein l\u00e4cherlicher Kalender aus Papier mit einem glitzernden Haus vorne drauf \u00fcbrig bleibt. Und dann verbirgt sich hinter dem ersten T\u00fcrchen auch tats\u00e4chlich ein alberner Dachboden voller Ger\u00fcmpel! Aber trotzdem: Irgend etwas ist besonderes an dem Geschenk der Mutter. Und wirklich entdeckt Julia, dass ihr Adventskalenderhaus voller Leben und voller Geschichten mit K\u00f6nigen, L\u00fcgnern, Zwergen und verlorenen Geheimnissen steckt, in die sie selbst eintauchen und hineinspazieren kann. Und das wird auch f\u00fcr Leser zu einem echten, kunterbunten Vorweihnachts-Vergn\u00fcgen. [image] Richtig bekannt wurde die 47-j\u00e4hrige Illustratorin Cornelia Funke erst, als sie vom Zeichenstift an die Computer-Tastatur \u00fcberwechselte und phantastische Kinderb\u00fccher f\u00fcr Kinder und Erwachsene schrieb. Drachenreiter, Herr der Diebe, Tintenblut und Tintenherz legen hiervon beredtes Zeugnis ab. Hinter verzauberten Fenstern hat im Vergleich zu diesen Mega-Sellern vielleicht die kleinere, stillere Geschichte, ist aber nicht weniger phantasievoll als diese. Und auch hier kommt zum Tragen, dass Funke als Zeichnerin angefangen hat: denn sie zeichnet ihre literarischen Bilder derart lebendig und warm, dass man ihr selbst die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Fiktion dankbar glauben will. Hinter verzauberten Fenstern ist ein wundervoll leises, m\u00e4rchenhaftes Buch, bei dem sich dem Leser hinter jeder Seite eine neue Welt er\u00f6ffnet. Wie bei einem guten Adventskalender eben -- und vor allem bei solchen, die nicht aus Schokolade sind und auf den ersten Blick etwas entt\u00e4uschend wirken.

Nat\u00fcrlich berichtet er Sophie ausf\u00fchrlich \u00fcber seine neuen Entdeckungen und aufregenden Erlebnisse. Als der erste Schnee f\u00e4llt und Weihnachten naht, steht f\u00fcr Sophie am Nikolausabend eine gro\u00dfe \u00dcberraschung vor der T\u00fcr. Die Autorin Annette Langen hat f\u00fcr Kinder eine humorvolle und informative Geschichte \u00fcber das Reisen geschrieben. Die Weltreise des kleinen Hasen Felix wird von der Illustratorin Constanza Droop mit einer F\u00fclle bunter, liebevoller Bilder begleitet. Der Hit des Buches sind die \"echten\" Felix-Briefe, die den passenden und sogar frankierten Umschl\u00e4gen entnommen werden k\u00f6nnen. Bereits erste Leseanf\u00e4nger k\u00f6nnen diese ohne M\u00fche selbst entziffern -- denn Felix erledigt seine Korrespondenz in gut lesbaren Gro\u00dfbuchstaben. Die gr\u00f6\u00dfte \u00dcberraschung wartet dann am Ende des Buches, wenn Felix mit seinem buntkarrierten K\u00f6fferchen vor der Haust\u00fcr steht und der kleine Leser selbst die mitgebrachten Reisesouvenirs auspacken darf. Briefe von Felix ist ein exzellentes Kinderbuch mit einer sch\u00f6nen Geschichte und einer ausgefallenen Ausstattung. Alles zusammen tr\u00e4gt mit Sicherheit dazu bei, dass es in k\u00fcrzester Zeit zum Lieblingsbuch der kleinen Leser und gro\u00dfen Vorleser wird. --Manuela Haselberger"}, {"title": "The Church Mice at Christmas", "description": "When Arthur and Humphrey decide to rally the church mice into having a Christmas party, the result is a series of disasters."}, {"title": "Baller Boys", "description": "Through a school newsletter, Shay and Frankie find out that the local football club are having trials and decide to try out for the team, but are both boys good enough?

Inspired by a favorite childhood story, The Story of Ping, Brett writes of six hens in China. Cared for by the young Mei Mei, the hens lay eggs for selling at the market. But one hen, Daisy, is not so happy. Picked at and plucked by the others, she is ousted from the clan and often sleeps alone on the cold damp floor. Eager for a good night's rest, she retires to a basket on the edge of the river. But the river rises and takes Daisy with it! She awakes surrounded by water and soon fends off a frightful dog, a terrifying buffalo, and a clan of squawking monkeys. But Daisy stands up to every one of these creatures and survives the wild waters. However, when a fisherman captures her and plans to eat her for dinner, there is nothing she can do. Meanwhile, Mei Mei's unsuccessful search for Daisy ends as she tearfully packs up the eggs and heads to market. Luckily, she finds Daisy there, and with a little call of \"Gu-gu-gu-gu-gu!\" Daisy comes running.Back at the henhouse, Daisy uses her newly learned skills to stave off the mean hens and gain a rightful spot on the perch. Brett's illustrations truly amaze. Her well-known eye for detail flourishes in the beautiful land of China. From exquisite landscapes to the fine features of all the animals, Brett lets her imagination and her wondrous skill take hold. Mountains become animals upon closer investigation, and the market will entice readers with its color and the bustling activity of the many people selling their wares. Brett traveled to China for inspiration and it shows in every page. The layouts are framed with bamboo and feature mini-scenes from the story in the corners. This tale of empowerment will appeal to young readers as Daisy stands on her own and doesn't run away. Rather, she returns to face her foes and holds her ground. An important lesson and a beautiful tale.

Until quite recently almost half the population of the world lived under regimes that claim to be Marxist. This very success, however, has meant that the original ideas of Marx have often been modified and his meanings adapted to a great variety of political circumstances.

I have become what Mama set out for me to be. Majestic. A Dauphine and eventually a Queen.\"  So writes the headstrong 13-year-old Maria Antonia--future Queen of France--in her diary on October 23, 1769. In this engrossing addition to the Royal Diaries series (Elizabeth I: Red Rose of the House of Tudor, Cleopatra VII: Daughter of the Nile), Kathryn Lasky invents a diary of the young Marie Antoinette in 1769--the year she is to be married off to Dauphin Louis Auguste, eldest grandson of the French king Louis XV. Arranged marriages were common in that day and age--as the Empress Theresa (of the Holy Roman Empire of the Germanic Nations) sought to consolidate power among nations by marrying off her children. Thus, the future of Austria and France falls upon Maria Antonia's young shoulders. To prepare her for this awesome responsibility, she must be trained to write, read, speak French, dress, act... even breathe. Things get even more grim as she is shipped off to the court of Versailles and introduced to her puffy, awkward future husband and confronted with the court's ridiculous customs. Marie--an opinionated and insightful young woman--mocks the court of \"impeccable etiquette and manners\" that makes up nasty rhymes about those they hate, but panics when her hair is mussed. Lasky has done an excellent job of creating a very human character in the young Marie Antoinette--one whom young readers will want to learn more about. Fortunately, her story is given plenty of context with an epilogue describing the history of the young Queen after 1769, a historical note offering an 18th-century context, a Habsburg-Bourbon family tree, and various portraits of the royal family.
